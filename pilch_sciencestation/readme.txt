Installation:
	If you have a previous version of the mod installed, delete it's folder from starbound/mods/
	Copy the folders pilch_sciencestation/ and modules-in-a-box/ to starbound/mods/

Features:
	Science Station - advanced crafting table to craft new items (Unlocks with "Starmap Upgrade MK3", made at Robotic Crafting Table)
	Base In A Box - instantly deployable base modules for a variety of purposes (Unlocks with "Starmap Upgrade MK3", made at Science Station)
	Medical Tank - sleep in this for increased healing (Unlocks with "Durasteel Tech Upgrade", made at Science Station)
	Laser Furnace - smelt stuff instantly, no standing around (Unlocks with "Durasteel Tech Upgrade", made at Science Station)
	Building Scanner & Printer - scan in custom buildings and print them elsewhere (Unlocks with "Durasteel Tech Upgrade", made at Science Station)

Misc stuff:
	Tables - recipes for all ten tiers of tables are now available as you reach each tier
	Kitchen counters - a kitchen-ready version of each table is also available
	Hi-tech Tents - slightly larger versions of the existing tents, that heal for more

Known issues:
	Standing in a building as it's being printed is asking for trouble
	Scanning a building with a chest in it results in all the contents being dropped on the floor
	Scanner cannot scan plants, trees, unbreakable objects or objects that don't anchor - ie: objects that can be placed in the air
	Furniture that is scanned in will only be printed facing the same way if it's a wire type object (turrets, doors, switches, etc), everything else will just face right - this is a limitation of the modding API sadly
	Building Scanner & Printer are highly experimental, so if they break or don't behave as expected, please let me know what happened, with steps to recreate the problem if possible
	Bug reports can either be sent on the forums or emailed to darth_pingu@yahoo.co.uk
